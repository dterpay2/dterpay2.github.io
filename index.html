    <h1><em>David Terpay</em></h1>
    <p class = "helloworld">
    I am a freshmen at UIUC studying Computer Science and Economics. I start and end my day with a quality meme.
    </p>
    <p class = "introduction">
      I am an ambitious coder ready to tackle any problem that stackoverflow or leetcode might have. I am fluent in Python, Java
      and C#. I enjoy twiddling around with APIs such as Twitter, Youtube, and Facebook. I have worked on several projects ranging from an EscapeRoom in Virtual Reality to
      a Youtube sentiment analysis program that can help predict who will win an election race.
    </p>
    <p class = "characteristics">
      I am a life long student and have only one fear: being "kinda" good at anything I put my time into.
      When I set my mind to do something, I won't "kinda" get the results or "kinda" understand
      the matter; I will develop my skills until I reach a point that I can teach somebody else the
      subject matter. Reading something will let you learn something new. Rereading will allow you to memorize
      something new. Explaining something to another person will allow you to <em>understand</em> something new. Being a good student
      is synonymous with being a good teacher.
